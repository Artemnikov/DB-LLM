Hello.

This project is an example on how can we use tools like datasets and langchain
to "communicate" with our database.

In summary. It is an integration with a LLM and a mysql database so the LLM is aware of the data and can querry the relevant data by predicting the data we want.

In the repo we can use an example database (mysql community) and add some data into it
